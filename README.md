It was just a school project which my teachers FORCES me and my teammates to do. If you find any bugs, please contact me @TataOwO#4689 on discord.
The idea of the game was from a classical arcade game. I don't like stealing, it was my teammates' idea, don't judge me...

main.py is what you want to run to play the game.
In JSON folder is where the map data are stored. Map_Editor.py is... as the name, map editor...

controls:
WASD to move
J to shoot
Mouse scroll to change maps

map editor:
Simple to use, left click to place, right click to remove. Click at the right edge of the screen to exit map editor and save all data.
